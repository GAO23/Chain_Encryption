# Text-Crypt
The purpose of this app is to encrypt your file into total gibberish, which is useful if you want something like a master file to store all your online passwords or send secret messages over email. The encryption is based on AES 128 bit standard.
So far it can support .txt files and ..... pretty much everything else. :-D
I should've name it to something else like universal crypt.

# Java veriosn instruction 
Java version is finished. Download the Text-Crypt.jar in java version folder and make it executable to run the application. Make sure java runtime enviorment from the oracle website is installed beforehand. I am not packaging the jar into a windows .exe executable because it defeats the whole purpose of cross platform language like java. You will need to know how to run a jar on your own.

Latest jar is thoughly tested on both windows and linux. Mac OS is not yet tested.

Bugs fixed: Changing the salted key length to 128 from 256 to ensure compatibility with older Java JRE.

# Android version instruction
I am working to port it to android right now

# QT version instruction
This will be done after android port is done. I will create a .exe executable for windows and an executable .sh for linux. I may even create an installer for both platform cuz why the hell not? No executable for Mac platform beacuse I have no mac and I don't know how to use a mac. Use java version if you wanna run the software on Mac OS.
