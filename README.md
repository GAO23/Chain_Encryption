# Text-Crypt
The purpose of this app is to encrypt your text file into total gibberish, which is useful if you want something like a master file to store all your online passwords or send secret messages over email. The encryption is based on AES 128 bit standard.

# Java veriosn instruction 
Java version is finished. Download the Text-Crypt.jar in java version folder and make it executable to run the application. Make sure java runtime enviorment from the oracle website is installed before hand. I am not packging the jar into a windows .exe executable because it defeats the whole purpose of cross platform language like java

# Android version instruction
I am working to port it to android right now

# QT version instruction
This will be done after android port is done. I will create a .exe executable for windows and an executable .sh for linux. I may even create an installer for both platform cuz why the hell not? No executable for Mac platform beacuse I have no mac and I don't know how to use a mac. Use java version if you wanna run the software on Mac OS.
