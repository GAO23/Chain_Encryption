# Project Overview
This will be a C++ software for encrypting all the text in a text file using an unique key

This will be my first C++ app and it will be a learning app. This means until the app reaches version 1.0 status, it will be full of irrelevent code such as hello world. 

This appliaction is made using qt creator IDE and utlizes the qt framework. It is programmed in C++ will be cross compatible in all major desktop operating system such as windows, linux, and mac OS. 

# Text-Crypt
The purpose of this app is to encrypt your text file into total gibberish, which is useful if you want something like a master file to store all your online passwords or send secret messages over email. 

It will be able to read text file and convert plain text into encypted jibberish using an user choosen password and will only succeed in decoding if the password is correct. It will have a graphical interface and ability to read and automatically encrypt/decrypt simple file like .txt
